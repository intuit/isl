**WIP**

This section is dedicated to the unit testing framework in ISL.

The goal of this framework is to add reliability to ISL code, by allowing creation of tests
to ensure critical behaviour within the script is maintained.

The goal of the framework is to be able to create unit tests entirely within the ISL langauge,
ensuring developers can make changes to the ISL tests when necessary, without the learning curve of
learning a new testing methodology.

The syntax and structure of the ISL testing framework is inspired by JUnit.

More reading on the implementation can be found here: [link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1E0wlMy5XrKL0lpgtu6IKqQRdbBUIz3f2gLZb5tR064g/edit?usp=sharing)
